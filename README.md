# 1. Overview
## 1.1 Summary
The goal of this project is to practice fundamental front-end web development skills by creating a mock-up website of the Vietnamese Students' Association club.

# 2. Organisation
## 2.1 Progress Tracking
A kanban board (Trello) will be used to document tasks to be completed. These tasks will be categorised into one of three columns:
* TO DO
* IN PROGRESS
* COMPLETED

# 3. Technologies
The website's stack comprises of the following:
* HTML
* SCSS

The down-side of not using a CMS (Content Management System) is that the websites' contents must be directly edited in the HTML files themselves.

The website is hosted on Netlify.

The current, actual website for the club lacks responsiveness leading to non-user friendly displays on mobile devices. I will be using a 'mobile-first' approach in designing my mock-up, and use media queries to ensure responsiveness.
