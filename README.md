vsa-vic-clone v1

# 1. Overview
## 1.1 Summary
The goal of this project is to practice my basic front-end web development skills through creating a mock-up website of the Vietnamese Students' Association club in Victoria. At the same time, I will be analysing the current website (vsavic.com as of January 2020), and explain how I will attempt to further improve the overall user experience and design. 

# 2. Organisation
## 2.1 Progress Tracking
A kanban board (Trello) will be used to document tasks in the form of user stories to be completed. Each user story will be in the template 'As a <role>, I want to <goal> so that <reason>'. These user stories will be categorised into one of three columns:
    * TO DO
    * IN PROGRESS
    * COMPLETED

# 3. Technologies
The website's stack comprises of the following:
* HTML
* SCSS

The down-side of not using a back-end or CMS (Content Management System) is that the websites' contents must be directly edited in the HTML files themselves.

# 4. Features
## 4.1 Responsiveness
The current website lacks responsiveness leading to non-user friendly displays on mobile devices. I will be using a 'mobile-first' approach in designing my mock-up, and use media queries to ensure responsiveness.
