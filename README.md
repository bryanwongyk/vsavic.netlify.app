>Note: This website was built after completing my first two online courses on front-end development, so there are many improvements that can be made.
# 1. Overview
## 1.1 Summary
The goal of this project is to practice fundamental front-end web development skills by creating a mock-up website for the Vietnamese Students' Association club. This means using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without the use of any other frameworks or libraries.

# 2. Technologies
The stack comprises of the following:
* HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* SASS pre-compiler for CSS

The down-side of not using a CMS (Content Management System) is that the websites' contents must be directly edited in the HTML files themselves.

The website is hosted on Netlify.

The 'About' page will feature text introducing the club, its mission and activities, as well as a hyperlink to the 'Committee' page.

## 4.2 Responsiveness
> In-progress. The website currently only fits a mobile view, but full responsiveness is still not complete.

I will be using a 'mobile-first' approach in designing my mock-up, and use media queries to ensure responsiveness.

# 5. Future Improvements
[ ] Full responsiveness (tablet, desktop)
[ ] Store images on Cloudinary
[ ] Hold data for club events in a database (e.g. MongoDB), rather than hard-coding it in (e.g. Events page)
[ ] Performance optimisation
