<i> This is a mock-up website for VSA Victoria. 
<br>
This project initially started as a way for me to practice pure <b>HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript</b> after completing my first two web development online courses. 
<br>
Since then, I have upgraded it to implement <b>ES6 syntax, TypeScript, Eleventy, and EJS. </b> I have also included other utility libraries like <b>Webpack</b> for bundling and <b>Prettier</b> for formatting. <b> Cloudinary </b> is used for most of the image hosting.</i>
